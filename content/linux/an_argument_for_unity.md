I have seen so much hate on Ubuntu’s Unity over the past year or so. With
this new release, I figured I should write down my thoughts on why I
choose to use Unity. Perhaps if you are one of those “Unity haters,” this
might give you a slightly different perspective.

Background
-----------

For those who don’t know my Linux background, let me quickly bring you up
to speed. I started using Linux when I started getting interested in
servers in 2000. The first distro I had exposure to was RedHat (Before the
Fedora conversion). In 2003, I was getting annoyed with some of the “RedHat
-isms,” so wanting to try something a little different I transitioned over
to SUSE. I had never tried KDE before this point and I was curious what the
hype was about. This was a very short lived change. While SUSE seemed more
refined, it also seemed to exacerbate the primary issue I had with RedHat
which was the packaging system. After a year, I had enough. I knew that
there were alternatives so I started trying everything I could get my hands
on. I finally ended up trying up Debian and man… it was a breath of fresh
air. Fast-forward to 2005, I hear about a new release (Hoary Hedgehog)
from a pretty new Debian-based distro called Ubuntu. I installed it and the
most shocking thing happened… everything seemed to work. For those relatively
new to the Linux world, in the early 2000s things generally didn’t just
“work.” Once you got them to work they did, but this was something completely
amazing to me. From then on, I was hooked!

Why
----

As I started with RedHat, I came from a traditional Gnome world. I have used
and loved pure Gnome for the majority of my history with Linux; minus a small
flirtation with Fluxbox. However, when Ubuntu switched to this new thing
called “Unity” in 11.04 I was really upset. After only trying it for an
hour or so It seemed buggy, slow, and like a huge step back from everything
I had come to love with Ubuntu. I’ll be honest, up until April of this year,
I thought I was going to be sticking with a different window manager. However,
when I read on Mark Shuttleworth’s blog about the concept behind the “HUD” I
was really fascinated. I started wondering if this new thing could speed up
my workflow and maybe relieve some stress on my hands from working a mouse.
This is what motivated me to give 12.04’s Unity a try.

Results
--------

To make sure I gave it the good “old college try” I made a pact with myself
that I would use it for at least one whole work week (40 hours) before I
would make any judgements. By the end of that week, something clicked and I
finally got it. I finally understood why Unity is so important. To me it is
about performance. Let me explain. A lot of people think that performance
is only about making the same thing work really fast. While this is
partially true, that isn't everything. Performance is really a user
perception on the total experience. This is often why people believe reactive
interfaces are faster. They see a constant stream of activity which leads
them to perceive that it is performing very well. The dirty little secret
is that when certain things perform faster, it changes how people use it.
This is what really changed my opinion on Unity.

I realize now that I was stubbornly holding on to the old Windows UI paradigms
and I was rejecting something new that could make me more efficient. In the
case of Unity, I can launch applications, search for files, and navigate
complex application menus extremely fast. Just to put this into perspective,
most applications I use on a daily basis I can launch with the following key
sequence: super/win key + (the first one or two letters of the application
name) + enter. For an action that I repeat all day long, this saves a ton of
time and wrist stress. The same applies to the HUD for application menus.

If you are like I was, I would encourage you to try Unity in Ubuntu 12.10
for a week before you hate on it. You might just discover, like I did, that
it can be quite an enjoyable experience.
