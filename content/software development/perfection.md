There is no such thing as perfection in the world of software. In fact,
a developer who believes they can actually achieve perfection or can
produce perfect code is unbelievably dangerous. Why? When a developer
believes that it is possible to produce perfect code, they refuse to see
what could actually go wrong. This is equivalent to a blind person
attempting to cross a busy freeway unassisted. Sure they might make it,
but it is definitely not safe, and absolutely not recommended.

Let me be clear, this is not a free pass to skimp on quality. Just
because we can’t build the perfect system, doesn’t mean that we shouldn't
strive for one. See, while we understand that we cannot create perfect
code, we as developers should still always pursue it. However, we should
pursue perfection with eyes open to our own faults and potential
shortcomings. We need to focus on developing the best code we can while
making sure we are looking for all the junk that could potentially go
wrong with it. Murphy’s law is always at play with software when it is
deployed. However, when we take time to discover what could go wrong
during development, we can take appropriate action to create assertions,
unit tests, error handling, and/or exception handling to help mitigate the
potential fallout. When the appropriate actions are taken, we can deliver
a much higher quality product. So in essence, you can’t develop perfect
code, but with the proper checks and balances in place you should be able
to get relatively close.
