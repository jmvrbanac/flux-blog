For those developers who enjoy a darker editing window with their
IDEs, you might enjoy this color scheme for Flash Develop 4. I use it
quite extensively as I'm a bit of a sucker for dark gray and blue
syntax highlighting. Currently, I only have the highlighting done for
AS2, AS3, XML, and plain text. Enjoy!

**Sample:**
