Authors: John Vrbanac

I just published a new release of lplight. For those who aren't familiar
with lplight, it is a simple lightweight client for interacting with the
Launchpad API. Currently, due to the complicated nature of authenticating
to Launchpad, lplight only provides anonymous/read-only access.

* PyPI: [lplight](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lplight)

**Supported Python Versions:**

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install lplight -U
```
