I'm currently in the process of building a rather interesting testing
library for Python. I'll write something about that in the future. Anyhow
I needed a simple and lightweight method of capturing and dispatching test
events. I didn't really like some of the options available out there, so I
just tossed together a simple port of ActionScript's EventDispatcher as I
kind of like the clear declarations of dispatching and listening events.
Anyhow, if y'all want to play around with it check out the GitHub project
or the package on PyPI.
