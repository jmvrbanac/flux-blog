Fresh off the press! This evening I have pushed up the latest version
the Specter up on PyPI. For those who aren't familiar with it, Specter
is a Python testing framework inspired from RSpec and Jasmine. One of
the primary goals around Specter is to bring a more expressive and
a code-centric method of doing Behavior Driven Development in Python.

If you're interesting in some of the changes included in this release
please take a look at the [release notes](http://specter.readthedocs.
org/en/latest/release_notes/index.html).

This latest version is also provided in wheel format for faster download
and installation.
